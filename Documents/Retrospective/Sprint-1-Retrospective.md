😑 😑 😑 🙂 
The team is doing a good job supporting and helping each other.
Optimistic that the team will find its footing.
confused and stressed at times.
A good retro session.  I think in the next sprint the team is going to improve and come back stronger.
I feel a bit confused at times but lately, I feel a bit confident in the team as they are trying to help each other.

🙂 What went well
Kudos to the team for really helping and being there for each other.  
Better Communication between team members and a clearer definition of roles  
The team was able to achieve GitHub setup and DevOps setup this week. We were able to learn about Dyslexia and in ways it affects a person.
The team has picked up some pace compared to last week. It was good to see that the team is finally settling and getting on the right track.
Contributions were limited from my side due to the vacation. But was able to complete the story chosen which is research on dyslexic style rules.

🙁 What didn't go well

The team is still picking up the pace when it really should be that the team should have been in full steam ahead.
The team does a lot of work but is not showing the work by regular commits on GitHub and updating Azure Boards.
Team members could be more independent and pick up tasks and work to be done rather than being allocated by the scrum master.
The development pace is low
I feel the pace of the project needs to be changed as the intermediate deliveries are getting closer.
The team wasn't able to communicate properly in the beginning and much of the things were unorganized.

💪 What needs to change
GitHub activity should be much higher.
I think we as a team can get better at teamwork.
Team members should communicate technical difficulties earlier.
team members can do much better with time management
The team should be more committed to attending Standups

Scrum Master can do a better job in organizing and conducting scrum ceremonies
Has to have a clear idea of how the project development is going to progress. Too many unknown pieces
Team members should do a much better job updating the Azure Boards and daily committing things on GitHub.  
Needs more organization and continuous communication
The team needs to start picking up tasks on their own and then help out those who are lagging is what I feel.
The team has to communicate better.

🌟 Shout Outs
Shoutout to our members for organizing the tasks on the Azure boards and making everyone attend the standup. They discussed openly about our problems and put them out in front of us for really helpful discussion.
I appreciate the team members who have supported me and been there for me this past week during a difficult part of my life. Thanks.
Shoutout to the team for setting up the DevOps and Github. Also, for automating a lot of processes to make the development for the rest of our project much more seamless.
for the team to for all the work in setting up the Azure boards and integrating the deployment pipeline
for retro sessions to understand the team’s grievances.
