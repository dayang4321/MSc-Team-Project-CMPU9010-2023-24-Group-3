Project Purpose:

Create a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model in Keras utilizing LSTM layers for headline generation.
Create an encoder-decoder architecture with the goal of generating headlines from text input.
We investigated several strategies that used the (Seq2Seq) paradigm for headline generation.

First Model Configuration:

Preparing Data:

loaded and cleared an article dataset.
implemented tokenization and padding as part of text preprocessing.
Divide the data into sets for training and validation.
Architecture Model:

built a Seq2Seq model that consists of an encoder and a decoder.
used the encoder's bidirectional LSTM layers.
For output generation, configure the decoder with dense layers and LSTM layers.

Errors and their Solutions
Transition from One-Hot Encoding to Embedding Layer:

An embedding layer was added in place of the original one-hot encoding to increase performance and efficiency.
Problems with Dimensionality in LSTM Layers:

encountered issues because the LSTM layers' input and output dimensions weren't aligned.
Shapes of the hidden and cell states were modified to match the anticipated input dimensions of the LSTM.
Issues with Model Compilation and Training:

encountered errors that suggested problems with input shapes and loss functions during the model's compilation and training.
resolved by modifying the architecture of the model and verifying interlayer compatibility.
To handle target sequences, the loss function was changed from "categorical_crossentropy" to "sparse_categorical_crossentropy."
Error in GPU Compatibility:
