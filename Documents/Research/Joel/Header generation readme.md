Project Purpose:

Create a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model in Keras utilizing LSTM layers for headline generation.
Create an encoder-decoder architecture with the goal of generating headlines from text input.
We investigated several strategies that used the (Seq2Seq) paradigm for headline generation.

First Model Configuration:

Preparing Data:

loaded and cleared an article dataset.
implemented tokenization and padding as part of text preprocessing.
Divide the data into sets for training and validation.
Architecture Model:

built a Seq2Seq model that consists of an encoder and a decoder.
used the encoder's bidirectional LSTM layers.
For output generation, configure the decoder with dense layers and LSTM layers.
