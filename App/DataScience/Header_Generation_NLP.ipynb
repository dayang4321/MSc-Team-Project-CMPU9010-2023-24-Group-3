        "input_text = \"Spoiler alert: this recap is for viewers of Deutschland 83 on Channel 4 and Walter Presents, please refrain from posting details from later episodes if youâ€™ve see more. Catch up on episode four here Now thatâ€™s more like it. This was easily the best episode so far, a tense and dark hour in which a number of characters made decisions that will have far-reaching effects. Most of them bad, if Iâ€™m any judge. I understand those who feel that Deutschland 83 has teetered too far into the absurd to work as a serious drama, but I also felt that this week addressed many of those issues, giving us some good character development into the bargain.Is Martin still the worst spy in the universe? Quite probably, but again Iâ€™d argue that this is part of the point â€“ as much as a spy drama, itâ€™s a story about young people struggling to make the correct choices while being conspicuously and continually let down by authority figures. What the Wingers seem intent on doing is giving us a world populated by people who are trying desperately to do the right thing, but are repeatedly doomed to do wrong by the time in which they are living. The west Poor old Martin. No sooner had he shed his inhibitions in the ashram (and to Bonnie Tyler, no less) than he found himself called back to duty and ordered to Berlin, ostensibly to help out his sick mother by giving her his kidney. Of course, Martinâ€™s missions are never as simple as that, and thus our hero was really in Berlin as a patsy, a convenient way of ensuring that a bunch of explosives was delivered to the terrorist who wanted them â€“ with devastating effect. The bomb itself really happened and was really the work, as stated, of Carlos the Jackal. As to the mysterious planter of the bomb, Iâ€™m presuming he was another patsy of a kind, an associate of Carlosâ€™s who agreed to plant the bomb at the French cultural centre. Also worth noting: the suggestion that the East German government had some involvement in the West German bombing is not a new one and the case against Carlos was partially built from old Stasi files.Martin wasnâ€™t the only one having a bad time this week, as Alex realised that loveâ€™s young dream was not quite as rosy as he had hoped, a situation that led to him storming off from the Mansion of Manipulation, initially seeking solace in the ashram (like everyone else before him) before turning up and offering his services to the DDR. Itâ€™s rather typical of Tobiasâ€™s luck that, even though Alex rejected both his idea of returning to the army and his protestations of love, he ended up offering to spy for the East Germans without Tischbier having to sully his hands by suggesting it. That man is so smooth that even his failures turn into some sort of success. The east Over in the east, betrayal was the name of the game as Annett, not content with rejecting Thomas, chose to sell out his mobile library at the same time. Oh Annett, I will find this very hard to forgive, although I do wonder exactly what message she wanted to get to Martin. Did she think he wasnâ€™t going to turn up and help his mother? Because if that was the reason she contacted Schweppenstette, then I suspect she will end up regretting it. As for poor Thomas, now my favourite character on this show after his impassioned defence of literature, things donâ€™t look good for him at all. That will teach him to go talking about love and literature to the first innocent-looking blonde he meets. Nor are they looking good for Ingrid, even though a rather battered Martin did manage to make it in time to donate the kidney. Will she survive? A couple of weeks ago I would have said sure, but this show is getting notably darker by the week so, despite Lenoraâ€™s intervention, I would now put her chances at 50-50 at best.Stasi files â€¢ Martin really lost his innocence this week â€“ no sooner had he lectured Tobias about being a killer, than he finds himself murdering a stranger on a railway track. I do wonder how much longer he can square his conscience with the life he is having to lead. â€¢ It was also made clear that Tobias was responsible for Lindaâ€™s death â€“ he may not have driven the car, but thereâ€™s no doubting that he gave the order. â€¢ Still, I was impressed by the way in which Martin used my sisterâ€™s old technique of telling the truth so outlandishly that the other person doesnâ€™t believe you. Got us out of many a sticky situation with our parents, I can tell you. â€¢ Lenora (Maria Schrader) almost revealed a heart this week. Despite all the manipulation, I think she genuinely does love her sister, and she really sold the tension as she waited for Martin to arrive. (And Iâ€™m presuming that she is the reason why Martin made it East relatively fast, despite turning up bloody and battered to the checkpoint). â€¢ The Edel home really isnâ€™t a safe place for a fish. After Renate attempted to kill them off with champagne glasses last week, Ursula went a step further this week, dropping one on the ground as a minor act of revenge against her husband. â€¢ Talking of Ursula, I was amused by the relish with which she devoured Alexâ€™s toast. I understand why sheâ€™s protecting her son, but her commitment to that cause was still wildly entertaining. â€¢ One thing I wasnâ€™t sure of â€“ did Ursula intend Frau Netz to think Alex has Aids or was the secretary jumping to conclusions? â€¢ Regarding Frau Netz â€“ do we also think she might be one of Lenoraâ€™s secretaries, or is that a spy reveal too far? â€¢ I loved the way Yvonneâ€™s ashram mate took a moment to centre himself after Alexâ€™s outburst. Sometimes itâ€™s the small things that work. â€¢ I also continue to be amused by Walter Schweppenstette, despite his capacity for evil â€“ I was particularly taken by his discussion about Worcester sauce. Sorry, but Iâ€™m a sucker for a man who knows his condiments. Song of the week Only two songs again this week, but they were both well used. Iâ€™m giving the edge to Mad World by Tears for Fears just because it made this cover from Donnie Darko â€“ an improbable Christmas No 1 â€“ pop into my head for the first time in years. Quote of the week â€œGo on, give each other back rubs while the world goes up in a mushroom cloudâ€ â€“ Alex almost wins my heart with his impassioned take down of hippies. Weâ€™ve all been there, Alex. So what did you think â€“ do you approve of the increasingly dark tone? Who is in worse trouble, Alex or Thomas? What about Martin? Will Ursula continue to lie to her husband? And will Yvonne ever make it out of that ashram? As ever, all speculation and no spoilers welcome below â€¦\""
